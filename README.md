# responsive-portfolio

For this project, i created a responsive webpage portfolio using no css. I used a website called bootstrap, my portfolio has a working nav bar, it responsive to screen size. Also its personalized for me. It was a pretty tough project having to figure out how to use the grid. I had a lot of issue trying to figure out the rows and columns.
